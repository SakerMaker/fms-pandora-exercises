    Exercise summary:

    I wasn't sure if reading the CSV file was needed. I added it anyway in case it was.
    First, from this file, I call both read_file and decode files, which includes the functions to read the CSV file and decode its code. Each files have their own comments for better understanding.
    Then, I sort the associative array in descending order and print the result as desired.
